The type of load balancing that I usually use is Software Load Balancing. Where Load Balancing runs on a PC/Server, and the Load Balancing application is installed and needs to be configured before it can function.

Layer 4 in the OSI model is transport layer. The most common use of protocols at layer 4 are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). This is where it usually is hardware-based load balancer work. This load balancer uses special ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) to be able to do something (modify network packets) with very fast compared to other systems. Instead, use this system is very expensive.

Load balancingat the application layer 7 is able to check the contents of the packet sent and perform load balancing based on package contents if required. The downside of this is the large overhead that reduces scalability in comparison load balancing at the transport layer. Not like L4 limited load balancing, application for L7 load balancing very much like Nginx, HAProxy, Apache and many more. They all have their own strengths, weaknesses and characteristics to handle packets and distribute them on the server.
